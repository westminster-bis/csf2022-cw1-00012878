Welcome friend! This is fast and addictive 2D Snake game written powered by ```Python``` and ```pygame``` module.

The Snake grows every 2nd food eaten. As the player achieves every 15th score point the hard-core mode will activate. Hard-core mode will disappear after eating 4 units of food. Before the hard-core mode, there will be a warning for the player.

Enjoy!
