# CS fundamentals CW1 part B

This is a Coursework 1 "Part B" of the CSFun module (2022).
<br><br>
Welcome friend! This is fast and addictive 2D Snake game written powered by ```Python``` and ```pygame``` module.
<br>
Before running the **main.py** file, make sure you have ```python``` and ```pygame``` installed.

## Game Logic
The player has to collect food accroes the grass field without hitting itself and trespassing viewport border.
The Snake grows every 2nd food eaten. As the player achieves every 15th score point the hard-core mode will activate. Hard-core mode will disappear after eating 4 units of food. Before the hard-core mode, there will be a warning for the player.

Enjoy!
